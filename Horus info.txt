The Homogeneous Ontology for Recursive Uniform Schema (HORUS) is used as an internal data format
structure that enables the framework to reduce the permutations of transformations required by the framework.
The use of HORUS methodology results in a hub-and-spoke data transformation approach. External data formats
are converted to HORUS format, and then a HORUS format is transformed into any other external format. The
basic concept is to take native raw data and then transform it first to a single format. That means that there is
only one format for text files, one format for JSON or XML, one format for images and video. Therefore, to
achieve any-to-any transformation coverage, the frameworkâ€™s only requirements are a data-format-to-HORUS
and HURUS-to- data-format converter.
